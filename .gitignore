# extracted game data. These are way too big, and I'm not sure how wolcen devs are about copyright yet anyway, so don't commit by default.
# A small subset of these are committed, in `datamine` - only those required for ci and production builds
/datamine.tmp

# Test fixtures; datamine imports as an elm string, created by fixture.js
tests/Fixture/Json.elm

# search index. Can be derived from other stuff in /datamine using `yarn build-search-index`, no need to commit
