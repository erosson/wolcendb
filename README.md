# [WolcenDB](https://wolcendb.erosson.org)

A website with datamined [Wolcen](https://wolcengame.com) item/skill information, in the spirit of [poedb](https://poedb.tw) and the [PoE wiki](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/).
Built with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org), [create-elm-app](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app), [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Special thanks to [gabriel-dehan's WolcenExtractor](https://github.com/gabriel-dehan/WolcenExtractor), which does the datamining! Requires [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).


## Build and Run

You must install [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Run the website with already-exported Wolcen data in `/datamine` - the bare minimum:

* `yarn` installs our dependencies and does general one-time setup
* `yarn start` runs the website
* `yarn build` builds a production version of the website
* `yarn test` runs the unit tests, verifies that Datamine is valid
